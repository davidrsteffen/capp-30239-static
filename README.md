## Data Sources
The primary data source for these analyses was the annual American Community Survey.
These datasets are available at data.census.gov, and are publicly accessible.

Key datasets I used included: <br>

B27007 Medicaid/Means-Tested Public Coverage by Sex by Age <br>
B27010 Types of Health Insurance Coverage by Age <br>
S2704 Public Health Insurance Coverage by Type and Selected Characteristics

For state expansion decisions, I used a Kaiser Family Foundation dataset: <br>
